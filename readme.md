# Advent of Code 2020 Solutions (Python)
Advent of code provides some neat coding challenges for each day of december. The site can be found here: https://adventofcode.com/2020/ 

## What's here
This repository provided some solutions for some tasks based on the Python Programming Language.
Spoiler: its a good idea to try the tasks your own before watching the solution (or at the very least think of a way to solve them).
Commonly there is not one and one way only to solve a task. If you have an alternative solution, you're invited to push your code here.

I will only provide some solutions (if I find time for myself to solve some). Again, you're invited to push your solutions here.
